BiggerorSmaller.py is a simple Python program that outputs which of the two numbers you inputed are smaller.

*I'm open to any reccomendations of what I should add or change*

Python Packages needed to use all features and for it not to break: 

python3 (brew-macos): "brew install python3"

pyautogui: "pip install pyautogui"

(fractions and webbrowser should be installed by default)
